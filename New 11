You're a journalist. Kind of like National Geographic, but about education. I've provided you with an outline of the school aspect. Your task is to write a full-fledged unique text based on it. Don't overuse lists.

Not everything in the synopsis is interesting or important to parents and children. Use the topic from the beginning of the source text. Then pick up all the facts and figures that will interest parents and pupils about the topic. And write a full-fledged unique text based on them.

Relevance and completeness of details are very important. So is the price of evidence, terms, enumerations, explanations, structured information.

Style is also important. How would you tell this lecture on this topic to a stranger on the street? It is in simple words, in the third person. 

+ The text should have a structure: the title of our topic; 3-5 very short and neutral H2 headings;

+ Sentences should be short. And it should be a fact-rich text. Important - it is a text and not a set of lists.

+ The school name is always complete - i.e. do not abbreviate it.
